    <h3>
        The game
    </h3>
    <p>
        With both of your pairs, you face the following decision.
        You can choose from two options: these two options are indicated with <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>.
        <p>
        <i>The amount that you earn in this round does not depend only on your decision, but on the decision
            of your pair as well.</i>
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        If your partners run out of time, it is considered as they have chosen <b>Y</b>.
        Earnings are calculated according to these rules for all players.
        Possible payments of the game, also detailed earlier, will be displayed on your screen during the game
        which makes it easier to remember all possible outcomes.
        The result of the games appears on your screen after decisions have been made.
        The average of the two games will be your earnings in each round.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Your final payment
    </h3>
    <p>
        Each round is important for your final payment. By using a random number generator we will select
        4 rounds. The average of your payoffs in these 4 rounds will be your final payment.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Rating others
    </h3>
    <p>
        After you are shown the result of the game you will have the opportunity to rate other players on a
        scale from 0 to 10 according to how much you trust them. In a given round, you can only rate those who
        you have already met in one of the games up to the round you are in. By default, the neutral value of 5
        is set to everyone. In this step others can also evaluate your trustworthiness.
        In the first five rounds, these two elements (game, rating) are repeated five times, but in Round 6 we
        are going to introduce a new element: thereafter you will have the opportunity to share your rating with
        other players.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Communicate Ratings
    </h3>
    <p>
        From now on you can share your rating with two players, who will be selected randomly. They will remain
        your communication partners until the ender of the experiment.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Update Ratings
    </h3>
    <p>
        After all evaluation have been sent, the ratings you received from your communication partners will
        appear on your screen. At this stage, you have the opportunity again to change the points you allocated
        previously, including those scores about whom you obtained information.
